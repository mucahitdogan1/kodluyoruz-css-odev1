            <h1 style="opacity:1 ;">Magic Johnson</h1>
            <p>Earvin "Magic" Johnson Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is an American former professional basketball player. Often regarded as the greatest point guard of all time,[3][4][5] Johnson played 13 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers, leading the team to five NBA championships during their Showtime era. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the All-Star MVP Award. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.

            Johnson's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards, three NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, 12 All-Star games, and nine All-NBA First Team selections. He led the league in regular season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game in both the regular season (11.19 assists per game) and the playoffs (12.35 assists per game).[6][7] He also holds the record for most career assists in the playoffs.[8] Johnson was a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team"), which won the Olympic gold medal in Barcelona. After leaving the NBA in 1991, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team that traveled around the world playing exhibition games.[9]

            Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021, and became a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fameâ€”being enshrined in 2002 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as a member of the "Dream Team".[10] His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, are well documented.
                
            <br><br>
                
            Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex,[11] as well as an entrepreneur,[12] philanthropist,[13] broadcaster and motivational speaker.[14] His public announcement of his HIV-positive status helped dispel the stereotype, still widely held at the time, that HIV was a "gay disease" that heterosexuals need not worry about; his bravery in making this announcement was widely commended.[15] Named by Ebony magazine as one of America's most influential black businessmen in 2009,[16] Johnson has numerous business interests, and was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years, as well as being the team's president of basketball operations from 2017 to 2019. He is also part of a group of investors that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012 and the Los Angeles Sparks in 2014.[17] During Johnson's ownership of both teams, the Sparks won the 2016 WNBA championship, and the Dodgers won the 2020 World Series. Combining his playing career and sports ownership career, Johnson has 10 NBA championships, five each as a player and later as a minority-owner of the Lakers.[18]
